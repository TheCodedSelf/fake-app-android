MAKING BIG CHANGES


Another bug fix


## Cherry-pick

1.35.0 is going to be huge!


## Cherry-pick PR

We want to detect squashed PRs with multiple commits and make sure they are merged if possible. We also want to make sure ummerged PR can be merged later if possible. Let's make sure we are sending Slack 
notifications when needed and that the AutoMerge automation doesn't interfere with cherry-pick.

## Cherry-pick PR follow up

We want to open a single PR and then keep cherry-picking work as it comes through

## Dual tagging

We want to pick up changes for multiple versions and we want it to work both as a single and multi PR workflow

## Dual tag + single PR

We keep testing

## Header as first commit

Body as second commit

## Cherry-pick individual commits

Body so we create a 2nd commit

## Test incremental work

All in one commit

## About to squash this one

Some text

## Custom strings

We expect custom strings to be used for PR title, body and commit messages

## Cherry-pick failed notification

Expecting this text to be an issue when cherry-picking with missing PR in the middle
